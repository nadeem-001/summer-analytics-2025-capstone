#  Dynamic Pricing for Urban Parking Lots

##  Overview
This project was built as part of the Summer Analytics 2025 Capstone hosted by the Consulting & Analytics Club, IIT Guwahati.  
The goal is to simulate a real-time pricing engine for 14 urban parking lots using demand signals like occupancy, queue length, traffic, and special events.

##  Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Bokeh, Panel (for visualization)
- Pathway (for real-time simulation)
- Google Colab

 Workflow
Load and clean the dataset

Engineer features like occupancy rate and vehicle weight

Implement two pricing models:

Baseline (linear with occupancy)

Demand-based (weighted score)

Visualize price trends using Bokeh

Simulate real-time pricing using Pathwayâ€™s replay_csv()

Display real-time output using Panel
